/*Extend the `Shape` hierarchy from Question 3 to include a virtual function `display()`. Implement the `display()` function in each derived class to print information specific to the shape. Create an array of `Shape` pointers, pointing to objects of different shapes. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `display()` function for each object.*/
